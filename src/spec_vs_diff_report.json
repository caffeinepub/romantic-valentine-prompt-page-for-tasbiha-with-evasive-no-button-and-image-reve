  "summary": "Frontend implements a romantic single-screen prompt and a celebratory state with an evasive “No” button hook and pink/white theme styling, but there are gaps/risks around the exact “Yes/No” button labels, the provided image asset, and the introduction of unrequested auth/actor/backend-related code and a promotional footer/link.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Show exactly two options: “Yes” and “No”.",
      "reason": "The visible “Yes” button label appears to be “Yes! 💕” (includes punctuation/emoji), which does not match the requirement to present exactly “Yes” and “No”. The “No” button label cannot be verified due to truncation.",
